Experience the thrill of protecting your cookies in "WildForFood," a low-poly indie game crafted for the January Showcase. This game symbolizes my learning journey with Unity Learn and showcases the skills I've acquired. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is simple: Don't let the wild animals eat your cookies!

## Development Diary 📒

### Day 1:
Embarked on this exciting journey. Faced initial challenges in setting up the project and deciding the game genre. The idea evolved from an old indie game where the goal was to dodge police cars.

### Day 2:
A day of significant progress. Set up the initial scene, added a character controller, implemented character death, and more.

### Day 3:
Faced challenges with the enemy mechanics and timer script. Originally, when a player collided with an enemy, it would eat the player's cookie, and when two enemies crashed, they would explode and disappear. The gameplay seemed dull, so revised it to make enemies run in different directions upon collision. 

### Day 8:
The original plan for the Enemy Generator was to spawn enemies on a rotating plane around the player. However, this didn't work out, so pivoted to a central EnemySpawnArea.

### Day 13:
Added the End Game Screen and a GameStartScene.

### Day 16:
Fixed animator, but still faced issues with the 'Eat_b' animation.

### Day 18:
Resolved the 'Eat_b' animation issue. The issue was due to the character animation's inability to transition directly from 'run' to 'eat'. It had to transition from 'run' -> 'idle' -> 'eat'.

### Day 21:
Introduced the Cookie! Made the End Game Screen and GameStartScene operational, added particle effects, and fixed several bugs.

### Day 22:
Prepared a presentation and video for the game.
