# WildForFood
This project is a low-poly indie game I'm creating for January Showcase. 
This game is a representation of my skill and what I have learned on Unity Learn so far.
The is only one mission in this game: Not to let wild animals eat your cookies!

### Day 1:
Had trouble setting up the project. I didn't know what kind of a game I wanted to create. I remembered an old indie game where you needed to avoid police cars to gain a score (Not GTA), tried to find it with no success. But that was the idea for creating Wild for Food.

### Day 2:
This day was productive. I made a scene, added a character controller, character death, etc.

### Day 3:
It was hard. My original idea was: when a player collides with an enemy, it eats the player's cookie, and when an enemy + another enemy crash into each other, they make an explosion and disappear, but it looked boring, so I changed it (it would look good with cars). I made it so that when an enemy crashes into another enemy, they run in the other way or stay in place. I had lots of problems with the timer and "run in the opposite direction" script. At like 2:40 am, I fixed the code and pushed it to GitHub.
