# WildForFood
This project is a low-poly indie game I'm creating for January Showcase. 
This game is a representation of my skill and what I have learned on Unity Learn so far.
The is only one mission in this game: Not to let wild animals eat your cookies!

### Day 1:
Had trouble setting up the project. I didn't know what kind of a game I wanted to create. I remembered an old indie game where you needed to avoid police cars to gain a score (Not GTA), tried to find it with no success. But that was the idea for creating Wild for Food.

### Day 2:
This day was productive. I made a scene, added a character controller, character death, etc.

### Day 3:
It was hard. My original idea was: when a player collides with an enemy, it eats the player's cookie, and when an enemy + another enemy crash into each other, they make an explosion and disappear, but it looked boring, so I changed it (it would look good with cars). I made it so that when an enemy crashes into another enemy, they run in the other way or stay in place. I had lots of problems with the timer and "run in the opposite direction" script. At like 2:40 am, I fixed the code and pushed it to GitHub.
### Day 8:
My original idea for the Enemy Generator was to make a local plane and to spawn enemies on it, on a line segment. the plane would rotate around a single point (player). I wanted to do it like that was because I wanted for enemies to spawn around a single point (player) but not right in front of it.

The original idea didn't work. So I made an EnemySpawnArea in the middle of the map.
### Day 13:
Added the End Game Screen and added a GameStartScene
### Day 16:
Fixed animator but Eat_b still doesnt work
### Day 18:
Fised the Eat_b animator, It didnt work because the char animation couldn't transition run -> eat. It had to run -> idle -> eat.
### Day 21:
Added Cookie. Made the End Game Screen and GameStartScene (Main menu) work, added particles, fixed bugs. 
### This is project's final form.
